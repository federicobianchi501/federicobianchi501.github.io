I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Verona. My research focuses on the development of scalable Safe Policy Improvement methods in real-world environments that ensure improved performance while guaranteeing safety constraints. Furthermore, I am focusing on the development of Safe Policy Improvement techniques for multi-agent systems, as well as strategic planning methods based on Monte Carlo Tree Search in continuous domains. As a member of the ISLa - Intelligent Systems Lab, our research focuses on both methodological and applied aspects of AI, machine learning, and data analysis for intelligent systems. We delve into diverse methodologies ranging from reinforcement learning and uncertainty-aware planning to multi-agent coordination, probabilistic modeling, and statistical data analysis.
